# About the Dataset
The dataset captures the user behaviours of a banking mobile app. It allows us to see the date and time of app installation, as well as the features the users engaged with within the app. App behaviour is characterised as the list of app screens the user looked at, and whether the user played the financial mini-games available.

The app usage data is only from the user's first day in the app. This limitation exists because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company wants to target them with new offers shortly after the trial is over.

Above mentioned Dataset is stored in file - "appdata10.csv"

The list of top screen used by user to reduce number of feature is recorded in file - "top_screens.csv"
