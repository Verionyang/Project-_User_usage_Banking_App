# About the Dataset

The dataset captures the user behaviours of a banking mobile app. It allows us to see the date and time of app installation, as well as the features the users engaged with within the app. App behaviour is characterised as the list of app screens the user looked at, and whether the user played the financial mini-games available.

The app usage data is only from the user's first day in the app. This limitation exists because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company wants to target them with new offers shortly after the trial is over.

## For this mid-term project, we are here to understand the following questions: 
* What are the main factors drive a user to sign up for the paid service? 
* Does age play an important role in user's app usage, mini games usage, and enrollment? 
* Does the implementation of the mini games help increase the likelihood of enrollment? 
* What kinds of functions are appreciated by users and what are not? 
* Among all the functions, what types of functions have positive impact on the likelihood of enrollment? 

### The original dataset consists of the following 2 files: 
1. Above mentioned Dataset is stored in file - "appdata10.csv"
2. The list of top screen used by user to reduce number of feature is recorded in file - "top_screens.csv"

### After exploratory data analysis, the following 2 files are stored under the 'data/clean' folder:
1. The cleaned-up version of the appdata - 'appdata_cleaned.csv'
2. The list of top screen categorised by their functionalities - top_screen_sorted.csv
